\secrel{17.2 Reactive Application 201}\secdown

Now consider an expression like (current-seconds). When we evaluate it, it
returns a single number representing the current time. For instance,
\lst{17/2/1.rkt}
However, even as we stare at this value, it is already out-of-date! It
represents the time when the function application occurred, but does not stay
current.

\input{17/2/1/timer}
\input{17/2/2/callback}
\input{17/2/3/alt}
\input{17/2/4/trans}
