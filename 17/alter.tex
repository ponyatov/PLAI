\secrel{17 Alternate Application Semantics 195}\secdown

Long ago \ref{}, we considered the question of what to substitute when
performing application. Now we are ready to consider some alternatives. At the
time, we suggested just one alternative; in fact there are many more. To
understand this, see whether you can answer this question:

Which of these is the same?
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item 
(f x (current-seconds))
  \item 
(f x (current-seconds))
  \item 
(f x (current-seconds))
\item
(f x (current-seconds))
\end{itemize}

What weâ€™re about to find is that this fragment of syntax can have wildly
different run-time behaviors. For instance, there is the distinction we have
already mentioned: variation in when (current-seconds) is evaluated. There is
variation in how many times it is evaluated (and hence f is run). There is even
variation even in whether values for x flow strictly from the caller to the
callee, or can even flow in the opposite direction!
