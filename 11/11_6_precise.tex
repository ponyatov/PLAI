\secrel{11.6 Precise Garbage Collection  . . 87}

In conventional GC terminology, the opposite of “conservative” is precise. This,
too, is a misnomer, because a GC cannot be precise, i.e., both sound and
complete. Rather, precision here is a statement about the ability to identify
references: when confronted with a value, a precise GC knows exactly what is and
isn’t a reference, and where the references are. This removes the monumental
effort that a conservative GC has to put into guessing non-references (and
hoping to eliminate as many potential references as possible through this
process).

Within the space of precise GC, which is what most contemporary language runtime
systems use, there is a wide range of implementation techniques. I refer you to
\href{ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/gcsurvey.ps}{Paul Wilson’s survey}
(which, despite its relative age in this fast-moving field, remains an excellent
resource), as well as the book and other materials from
\href{https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/rej/gc.html}{Richard Jones}. In
particular, for a quick and readable overview of a generational garbage
collector, read \href{http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/143.ps}{Simple
Generational Garbage Collection and Fast Allocation}.
