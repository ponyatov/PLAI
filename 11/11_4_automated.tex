\secrel{11.4 Automated Reclamation, or Garbage Collection  84}\secdown

Now let’s briefly examine the idea of having the language’s run-time system
automate the process of reclaiming garbage. We’ll use the abbrevation GC (for
garbage collection) to refer to both the algorithm and the process, letting
context disambiguate.
\note{Some people call reference counting a “garbage collection” technique. I
prefer to use the latter term to refer only to fully-automated techniques. But
do beware this potential for confusion when browsing the Web.}
