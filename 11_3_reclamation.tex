\secrel{11.3 Manual Reclamation   . . 82}\secdown

The most manual approach would be to entrust all de-allocation to the human. In
C, for instance, there are two basic primitives: malloc for allocation and free
to reclaim. malloc consumes a size and returns a reference to a store-allocated
value; free consumes the references and reclaims its assocated memory.
\note{“Moloch has been used figuratively in English literature from John
Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) to Allen Ginsberg’s ‘Howl’ (1955), to refer to a
person or thing demanding or requiring a very costly sacrifice.”\

\note{“I do not consider it coincidental that this name sounds like malloc.”
