\secrel{14.6.1 Presentation in the Language  125}

Writing programs in our little toy languages can soon become frustrating.
Fortunately, Racket already provides a construct called call/cc that reifies
continuations. call/cc is a procedure of one argument, which is itself a
procedure of one argument, which Racket applies to the current
continuationâ€”which is a procedure of one argument. Got that?

Fortunately, we can easily write let/cc as a macro over call/cc and program with
that instead. Here it is:
\lsts{14/6/1/1.rkt}{rkt}
To be sure, all our old tests still pass:
\lsts{14/6/1/2.rkt}{rkt}
