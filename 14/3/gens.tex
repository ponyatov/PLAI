\secrel{14.3 Generators   . . 117}

Many programming languages now have a notion of generators. A generator is like
a procedure, in that one can invoke it in an application. Whereas a regular
procedure always begins execution at the beginning, a generator resumes from
where it last left off. Of course, that means a generator needs a notion of
“exiting before it’s done”. This is known as yielding, namely returning control
to whatever called it.
