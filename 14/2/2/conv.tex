\secrel{14.2.2 Converting the Example  . . 114}

Let’s consider the example above and see what it converts to. You can either do
this by hand, or take the easy way out and employ the Macro Stepper of DrRacket.
Assuming we include the application to identity contained in run, we get:
\note{For now, you need to put the code in \#lang racket to get the full force
of the Macro Stepper.}
\lsts{14/2/2/1.rkt}{rkt}
What! This isn’t at all the version we wrote by hand!

In fact, this program is full of so-called administrative lambdas that were
introduced by the particular CPS algorithm we used. Fear not! If we stepwise
apply each of these lambdas and substitute, however\ ---
\note{Designing better
CPS algorithms, that
eliminate needless
administrative
lambdas, is
therefore an
ongoing and open
research question.}
\DoNow{Do it!}
--- the program reduces to
\lsts{14/2/2/2.rkt}{rkt}
which is precisely what we wanted.
