\secrel{15 Checking Program Invariants Statically: Types 131}\secdown

As programs grow larger or more subtle, developers need tools to help them
describe and validate statements about program invariants. Invariants, as the
name suggests, are statements about program elements that are expected to always
hold of those elements. For example, when we write x : number in our typed
language, we mean that x will always hold a number, and that all parts of the
program that depend on x can rely on this statement being enforced. As we will
see, types are just one point in a spectrum of invariants we might wish to
state, and static type checking—itself a diverse family of techniques—is also a
point in a spectrum of methods we can use to enforce the invariants.
