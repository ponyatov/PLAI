\secrel{10.1.4 Constructors   . . 70}

A constructor is simply a function that is invoked at object construction time.
We currently lack such a function. by turning an object from a literal into a
function that takes constructor parameters, we achieve this effect:
\lsts{10/1/4/1.rkt}{rkt}
In the first example, we pass 5 as the constructor’s argument, so adding 3
yields 8. The second is similar, and shows that the two invocations of the
constructors don’t interfere with one another.
