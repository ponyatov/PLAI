\secrel{10.1.6 Private Members   71}

Another common object language feature is private members: ones that are visible
only inside the object, not outside it. These may seem like an additional
feature we need to implement, but we already have the necessary mechanism in the
form of locallyscoped, lexically-bound variables:
\note{Except that, in Java, instances of other classes of the same type are
privy to “private” members. Otherwise, you would simply never be able to
implement an Abstract Data Type.}

The desugaring above provides no means for accessing count, and lexical scoping
ensures that it remains hidden to the world.
