\secrel{10.1 Objects Without Inheritance  . 67}

The simplest notion of an object—pretty much the only thing everyone who talks about
objects agrees about—is that an object is
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item a value, that
  \item maps names to
  \item stuff: either other values or “methods”.
\end{itemize}
From a minimalist perspective, methods seem to be just functions, and since we
already have those in the language, we can put aside this distinction.
\note{We’re about to find out that “methods” are awfully close to functions but
differ in important ways in how they’re called and/or what’s bound in them.}
