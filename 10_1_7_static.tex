\secrel{10.1.7 Static Members   . 72}

Another feature often valuable to users of objects is static members: those that
are common to all instances of the “same” type of object. This, however, is
merely a lexically-scoped identifier (making it private) that lives outside the
constructor (making it common to all uses of the constructor):
\note{We use quotes because there are many notions of sameness for objects. And
then some.}
\lsts{src/10/1/7/1.rkt}{rkt}
We’ve written the counter increment where the “constructor” for this object
would go, though it could just as well be manipulated inside the methods.

To test it, we should make multiple objects and ensure they each affect the
global count:
\lsts{src/10/1/7/2.rkt}{rkt}
