\secrel{12 Representation Decisions 87}\secdown

Go back and look again at our interpreter for function as values \ref{}. Do you
see something curiously non-uniform about it?

\DoNow{
No, really, do. Do you?
}

Consider how we chose to represent our two different kinds of values: numbers
and functions. Ignoring the superficial numV and closV wrappers, focus on the
underlying data representations. We represented the interpreted language’s
numbers as Racket numbers, but we did not represent the interpreted language’s
functions (closures) as Racket functions (closures).

That’s our non-uniformity. It would have been more uniform to use Racket’s
representations for both, or also to not use Racket’s representation for either.
So why did we make this particular choice?

We were trying to illustrate and point, and that point is what we will explore
right now.
