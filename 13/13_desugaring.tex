\secrel{13 Desugaring as a Language Feature 91}\secdown

We have thus far extensively discussed and relied upon desugaring, but our
current desguaring mechanism have been weak. We have actually used desugaring in
two different ways. One, we have used it to shrink the language: to take a large
language and distill it down to its core \ref{}. But we have also used it to
grow the language: to take an existing language and add new features to it
\ref{}. This just shows that desugaring is a tremendously useful feature to
have. Indeed, it is so useful that we might ask two questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
Because we create languages to simplify the creation of common tasks, what would
a language designed to support desugaring look like? Note that by “look” we
don’t mean only syntax but also its key behavioral properties.
  \item 
Given that general-purpose languages are often used as a target for desugaring,
why don’t they offer desugaring capabilities in the language itself ? For
instance, this might mean extending a base language with the additional language
that is the response to the previous question.
\end{itemize}
We are going to explore the answer to both questions simultaneously, by studying
the facilities provided for this by \racket.
