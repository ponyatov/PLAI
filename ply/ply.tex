\secrel{Preface and Requirements}

This document provides an overview of lexing and parsing with PLY. Given the
intrinsic complexity of parsing, I would strongly advise that you read (or at
least skim) this entire document before jumping into a big development project
with PLY.

PLY-3.5 is compatible with both \py 2 and \py 3. If you are using \py 2, you
have to use \py\ 2.6 or newer.
