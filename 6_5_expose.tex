\secrel{6.5 Exposing the Environment  . . 31}

If we were building the implementation for others to use, it would be wise and a
courtesy for the exported interpreter to take only an expression and list of
function definitions, and invoke our defined interp with the empty environment.
This both spares users an implementation detail, and avoids the use of an
interpreter with an incorrect environment. In some contexts, however, it can be
useful to expose the environment parameter. For instance, the environment can
represent a set of pre-defined bindings: e.g., if the language wishes to provide
pi automatically bound to 3.2 (in Indiana).
