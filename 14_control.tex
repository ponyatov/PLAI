\secrel{14 Control Operations 102}\secdown

The term control refers to any programming language instruction that causes
evaluation to proceed, because it “controls” the program counter of the machine.
In that sense, even a simple arithmetic expression should qualify as “control”,
and operations such as sequential program execution, or function calls and
returns, most certainly do. However, in practice we use the term to refer
primarily to those operations that cause non-local transfer of control,
especially beyond that of mere functions and procedures, and the next step up,
namely exceptions. We will study such operations in this chapter.

As we study the following control operators, it’s worth remembering that even
without them, we still have languages that are Turing-complete, and therefore
have no more “power”. Therefore, what control operators do is change and
potentially improve the way we express our intent, and therefore enhance the
structure of programs. Thus, it pays to being our study by focusing on program
structure.
