\secrel{9.4 Without Explicit State   . . 66}

As you may be aware, there is another way to define recursive functions (and
hence recursive data) that does not leverage explicit mutation operations.

\DoNow{
You’ve already seen what goes wrong when we try to use just let to define a
recursive function. Try harder. Hint: Substitute more. And then some more. And
more!
}

Obtaining recursion from just functions is an amazing idea, and I use the term
literally. It’s written up well by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen in
their book, The Little Schemer. Read about it in
\href{http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/sample.pdf}{their sample chapter online}.

\Exercise{
Does the above solution use state anywhere? Implicitly?
