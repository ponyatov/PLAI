\secrel{9 Recursion and Cycles:\\Procedures and Data 62}\label{sec9}\secdown

Recursion is the act of self-reference. When we speak of recursion in
programming languages, we may have one of (at least) two meanings in mind:
recursion in data, and recursion in control (i.e., of program behaviorâ€”that is
to say, of functions).
