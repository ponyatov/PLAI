\textbf{Which of these is the same?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|f = 3|
  \item \verb|o.f = 3|
  \item \verb|f = 3|
\end{itemize}

Assuming all three are in Java, the first and third could behave exactly like
each other or exactly like the second: it all depends on whether f is a local
identifier (such as a parameter) or a field of the object (i.e., the code is
really this.f = 3).

In either case, we are asking the evaluator to permanently change the value
bound to f. This has important implications for other observers. Until now, for
a given set of inputs, a computation always returned the same value. Now, the
answer depends on when it was invoked: above, it depends on whether it was
invoked before or after the value of f was changed. The introduction of time has
profound effects on reasoning about programs.

However, there are really two quite different notions of change buried in the
uniform syntax above. Changing the value of a field (o.f = 3 or this.f = 3) is
extremely different from changing that of an identifier (f = 3 where f is bound
inside the method, not by the object). We will explore these in turn. We’ll
tackle fields below, and return to identifiers in section \ref{8_2_vars}.
