\secrel{13.7 Desugaring in Other Languages  . . 101}

Many modern languages define operations via desguaring, not only Racket. In
Python, for instance, iterating using for is simply a syntactic pattern. A
developer who writes for x in o is
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
introducing a new identifier (call it iâ€”but be sure to not capture any other i
the programmer has already defined, i.e., bind i hygienically!),
  \item 
binding it to an iterator obtained from o, and
  \item 
creating a (potentially) infinite while loop that repeatedly invokes the .next
method of i until the iterator raises the StopIteration exception.
\end{itemize}
There are many such patterns in modern programming languages.
